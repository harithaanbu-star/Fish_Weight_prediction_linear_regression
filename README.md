# Fish_Weight_prediction_linear_regression
This project predicts fish weight based on height using simple linear regression. The model explains about 42% of the variance in weight (R² ≈ 0.425) with an average prediction error of ~180 units (MAE).

The repository includes:
  The Fish.csv dataset
  Python code for data preprocessing, training, testing, and predicting

Example predictions for new heights
This project demonstrates linear regression concepts, model evaluation metrics, and how height influences fish weight.
